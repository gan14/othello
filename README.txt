Describe how and what each group member contributed for 
the past two weeks. If you are solo, these points will 
be part of the next section.

I worked solo on this project.

Document the improvements that your group made to your 
AI to make it tournament-worthy. Explain why you think 
your strategy(s) will work. Feel free to discuss any 
ideas were tried but didn't work out.

The AI was intially able to pass tests and beat 
Simpleplayer. In order to improve the AI and make it 
tournament-worthy, I decided to implement a 4-ply 
minimax decision tree, instead of a 2-ply one. This 
strategy will work because due to the greater number of 
plys, or "decision-depth", the AI is able to think 
through a greater number of moves ahead. Because of 
this, it is able to make better moves based on a more 
intelligent heurestic that maximizes the eventual score.

I also tried to implement the alpha-beta pruning 
strategy, but unfortunately, wasn't able to fully 
implement it before the deadline.
